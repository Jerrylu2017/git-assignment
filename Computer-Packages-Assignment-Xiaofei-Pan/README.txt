Thoughts about course project:

I only have the data for a former course project. I studied Chinese language learners' perception and production of  Chinese passive structure. The 38 participants were from two levels, intermediate and advanced.  The tests include grammaticality judgement test and cloze test. My research questions are:
1. Do learners of the two levels differ significantly in perception of Chinese passive structure?
2. Do learners of the two levels differ significantly in production of Chinese passive structure?

For that course project, I used SPSS to analyze the data. So I can use R or SAS to re-analyze my data.

I do not have any other data eligible for quantitative research.

Using other packages than SPSS may give me additional information about the results.

Yuan Lu’s comments:
Don’t use grammaticality judgement tasks, because professor Ke does not like them. Use some elicited production tasks, and you are more than welcome to work on usage-based theory to SLA.
